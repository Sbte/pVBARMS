README for examples/general directory
================================

This  directory contains  a few  test drivers  to solve  a distributed
sparse linear  system using preconditioned  FGMRES. 

 *  Bdd-HB-dse.c is a test program with a harwell-boeing matrix
    using pVBARMS's simple DSE partitioner.  ONE processor reads
    the whole matrix from a file and distribute to others[The matrix
    is assumed to be in the Harwell-Boeing format].
    It  then  partitions  its  graph  using DSE, a  simple partitioning
    routine, and scatters the local matrices to each processor. Once
    these submatrices are received each processor solves the problem
    using preconditioned (F)GMRES. See README or comments for the list of
    available preconditioners.


The command
%make Bdd-HB-dse.ex Bdd-mtx-dse.ex Bdd-bin-dse.ex
will create an executable for the corresponding driver.

To compile  the code in general,  make sure that the  makefile.in in
the home directory of pVBARMS has  been configured properly and make sure to
have  the library  generated [make  lib at  the top  directory  -- see
instructions on how to make the library]

All test drivers will read input test parameters 
from a file. The  sample input  file called  "inputs" in
examples/general is  read by default (i.e., when  the executables are
invoked with  no arguments on the command  line).  Another  file can
be  specified for the  inputs by entering it as an argument at the
command line. 

Example:

%mpirun -np <proc_number> Bdd-HB-dse.ex
The file called "inputs" will be read by the executable.

%mpirun -np <proc_number> Bdd-HB-dse.ex my_inputs
The file called "my_inputs" will be read by the executable.

The other files in this directory are:
	
- skit.f, a suite or routines adapted from SPARSKIT for processing matrices
            in Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix format
      
- aux.c,    reads input parameters for the run from a file

- inputs   : input file for various parameters 


NOTE: The functions defined in the above files handle both the real 
      and complex cases. See the driver for the preprocessor calls
      to the respective functions.

===================
Matrix Files
===================
The files, matfileReal and matfileCmplx contain a list of matrices 
to be tested. These matrices are stored in the /examples/matices/ 
folder, and contain both complex and real-valued matrices. matfileReal 
will read only the real matrices, and matfileCmplx will read only the 
complex-valued matrices.

The list of matrices to be tested is terminated by ##.

==========================
PRECONDITIONERS AVAILABLE 
==========================  

The following preconditioner methods are available in pVBARMS:

BJ, SCHUR, RAS

RAS indicates restrictive additive Schwarz preconditioner.

BJ indicates block Jacobi preconditioner.

SCHUR indicates Schur complement based preconditioner.

NOTE: SCHUR require inner iterations
(so ipar[3], ipar[4] should be > 0. It is a good idea to set 
ipar[3] = ipar[4] = a small number - e.g., 5) 

All above parallel preconditioners can be combined with the following
local preconditioners:

vbarms, vbarmsold, vbilut, vbiluk
